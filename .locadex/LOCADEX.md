# 🌐 Locadex Docusaurus i18n

This Docusaurus documentation site is configured to use Locadex for automated internationalization.

## Configuration:

- **Working Directory**: `.`
- **Branch Prefix**: `locadex/`
- **Default Locale**: `en`
- **Target Locales**: `en`, `es`

## How it works:

- Once this setup PR is merged, Locadex will automatically monitor your repository for changes
- Locadex will analyze your Docusaurus docs for translatable content and internationalize your changes in your configured locales
- You can configure when Locadex should run (PRs or commits) and whether it should create PRs or commit directly through the General Translation Dashboard
